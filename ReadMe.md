# BuggyJava+JML

The BuggyJava+JML dataset has 597 buggy programs, and each program has one bug. This dataset is created based on the [Java+JML dataset](https://github.com/Amirfarhad-Nilizadeh/Java-JML) by using [PITest](https://pitest.org/). PITest generates bugs by changing control conditions, changing assignment expressions, removing a method call, and changing return values. Only two bugs in this dataset are real bugs (from [QuixBug](https://github.com/jkoppel/QuixBugs)) that we add JML specification to their correct versions. 

Each buggy program has a formal specification in JML that describes the correct behavior of the program. Also, [OpenJML](http://www.openjml.org/) does verify the correctness of the correct versions of these programs. We used OpenJML 8.46 for this study, and you can find warnings besides each buggy program with the name "esc.txt" in the dataset. 

Among the 597 buggy programs, 40 have a bug that is not be detected with the JUnitTests dataset, and 10 of them go to an infinite loop during testing. Thus, for our APR study, we used 547 buggy programs.

# JUnitTests

JUnitTests were generated by running [Kelinci](https://github.com/isstac/kelinci) (the Java version of AFL fuzzer) 5 times on each program in the Java+JML dataset (correct version of programs) to cover all normal branch behavior. This test does not cover branches that are terminated by throwing an exception. Kelinci provides tests by covering all branches (other than these exceptional behaviors) in each run. Thus, each branch is covered at least 5 individual tests.

# NotVerified

Repaired programs cannot be verified with OpenJML for two main reasons.

1) The repaired program is overfitted. It means the repaired program is not correct based on the correct version of the programs' expected behavior, but it satisfies the test suite, which is provided with JUnitTests.  

2) It is a JML False Negative. It is possible that JML specification mistakenly considers a correct repaired program as overfitted. This happened for only about 4.15% of generated patches. We classified these false negatives into three classes: 1) Structural 2) Modularity 3) Overflow.

# TimeComplexityOrder

Our results show that the order of time complexity can change and increase dramatically by using current dynamic APR tools. It happened for seven repaired programs in our study. Increasing the order of time complexity is not a test overfitting problem in theory because the expected behavior is still correct. However, it could be a significant issue in practice by changing the program's character (changing binary search to a linear search).
