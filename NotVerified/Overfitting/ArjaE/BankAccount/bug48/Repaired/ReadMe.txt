One of the changes fixed the bug, but two other changes assign the "_balance" to the "balance" field in the pure "isValid()" method that has the protected visibility. The program is correct if the user only works with the "menu()" method, but isValid() can be called with a user and can change the value of "balance." Thus, we consider this program as a buggy one. Thus this dataset can be used to automatically and objectively evaluate test overfitting.
