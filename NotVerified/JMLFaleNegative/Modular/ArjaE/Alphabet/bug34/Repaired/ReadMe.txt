Generated patch repaired the bug,but also insearts "uppercase=('A' <= c && c <= 'Z');" in the "isAlphabetic()" method. Based on the specification the  "setAlphabetic();" can only modified "alphabetic" and "alfabetic_set" fields and not "uppercase" field. Thus, OpenJML cannot verify it, while the program is correct.

In this program, the only way to see the value of "uppercase" is by calling "isUppercase()," and it does not have any side effect if the value of "uppercase" changes during calling "isAlphabetic()." Even when "uppercase_set" is "true."
